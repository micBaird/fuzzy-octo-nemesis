Cordova Android Sound Manager Plugin
==============================

The purpose of sound manager is to enable an Android application to allow its users to choose a sound that they want to occur in the result of an  event. For example, the plugin will allow a user to choose the sound they want to occur for a specific notification.

### How it appears to the user
Users will be prompted by the native Android sound-picker to select a sound.

### Examples of Sound Usage
Sounds are ideally suited for applications with events that are customizable by the user, such as calendar and to-do list applications, or any application that triggers an alert to the user.
For example, if applications are presenting a notification to inform their users of an event, the user can choose a specific sound to associate with that application's notifications. A sound that is made specifically for the application can also be used.

### Plugin's Purpose
The purpose of the plugin is to create a platform independent javascript interface for [Cordova][cordova] based Android applications to access the specific API for Android.

## Supported Platforms

## ChangeLog
#### Version 0.2.0
- initial release

## Using the plugin
1. [navigator.ringtones.find][find]

### Plugin initialization
The plugin and its methods are not available before the *deviceready* event has been fired.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', function () {
    // navigator.ringtones is now available
}, false);
```

### Prompt user to select sound
Users can be prompted to select a sound through the 'navigator.ringtones.find' interface.<br>
The method takes a function (resultCallback) as an argument to specify the event that occurs after the user has selected a ringtone as well as another function (failureCallback) that is triggered in the event that an error occurs.

```javascript
navigator.ringtones.find(
  function () { ... },   // A function that is executed in the success of a selected sound
  function () { ... }    // A function that is executed in the failure of a selected sound
);
```


## Examples
### Returning the user-selected sound URI
```javascript
navigator.ringtones.find(
  function(sound_URI) {
    console.log(sound_URI);
  },
  function (message) {
    console.log(message);
  }
);
```

### Using the user-selected sound URI in combination with [local-notifications][local_notifications]
- You must include the local-nofications cordova plugin to excute this example.
```javascript
navigator.ringtones.find(
  function (sound_URI) {
    console.log(sound_URI);
    window.plugin.notification.local.add({ 
      message: 'Great app!',
      sound: sound_URI 
    });
  },
  function (message) {
    console.log(message);        
  }
);
```
